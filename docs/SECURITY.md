# Security Design Report

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
WhisperChain is a secure messaging platform designed for campus communities. The system implements end-to-end encryption, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logging while maintaining usability.

### 1.2 Components
- Frontend: React application with TypeScript
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- Encryption: RSA for message encryption
- Audit: Custom audit logging system

## 2. Security Rationale

### 2.1 End-to-End Encryption
- Messages are encrypted using RSA encryption
- Each user has a public/private key pair
- Public keys are stored in the database
- Private keys are stored securely on the client
- Messages can only be decrypted by the intended recipient

### 2.2 Role-Based Access Control
- Three roles: User, Moderator, Admin
- Users can send/receive messages
- Moderators can review flagged content
- Admins can manage users and system settings
- Row-level security policies enforce access control

### 2.3 Audit Logging
- All actions are logged with timestamps
- Logs include user IDs, action types, and metadata
- Privacy is preserved by not logging message content
- Logs are immutable and tamper-evident
- Access to logs is restricted to admins

## 3. Threat Model

### 3.1 Identified Threats
1. Message Interception
   - Mitigation: End-to-end encryption
   - Risk Level: Low

2. Unauthorized Access
   - Mitigation: RBAC + RLS policies
   - Risk Level: Medium

3. Content Abuse
   - Mitigation: Flagging system + moderation
   - Risk Level: High

4. Key Compromise
   - Mitigation: Secure key storage
   - Risk Level: High

### 3.2 Attack Vectors
1. Network Attacks
   - Man-in-the-middle
   - Packet sniffing
   - DNS spoofing

2. Application Attacks
   - SQL injection
   - XSS
   - CSRF

3. Social Engineering
   - Phishing
   - Key theft
   - Impersonation

## 4. Security Measures

### 4.1 Encryption
- RSA-2048 for message encryption
- Secure key generation and storage
- Key rotation capabilities
- Encrypted message storage

### 4.2 Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- Row-level security
- Session management
- Token-based authentication

### 4.3 Content Moderation
- Message flagging system
- Moderator review process
- One-way messaging restrictions
- Automated content filtering

### 4.4 Audit System
- Comprehensive event logging
- Tamper-evident logs
- Privacy-preserving design
- Admin-only access

## 5. Privacy Considerations

### 5.1 Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected
- Messages are encrypted
- Audit logs exclude sensitive content
- User data is minimal

### 5.2 Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Secure key management
- Access controls

## 6. Future Improvements

### 6.1 Planned Enhancements
- Key rotation system
- Enhanced content filtering
- Automated threat detection
- Improved audit analysis

### 6.2 Research Areas
- Post-quantum cryptography
- Advanced content moderation
- Privacy-preserving analytics
- Zero-knowledge proofs
